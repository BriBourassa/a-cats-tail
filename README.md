# A Cat's Tail

## Abstract

Have you ever thought to yourself, is my cat evil? Do you yearn for the nostalgia of taking care of a pixelated virtual pet? Well A Cat's Tail is there for you in your time of need. Take care of a virtual cat, and your choices just might affect the fate of the entire world. A new-age Tamagotchi for old-school gamers, with a twist.

## Preview of App:


## Learning Goals:

Our main goal was to better understand global state management though learning and implementing Redux Toolkit. We practiced E2E testing with Cypress, used React hooks, Router, fetch calls, and exercised teamwork with the Git workflow.

## Wins and Challenges:

- There was a bit of a learning curve with Redux, since it was our first time seeing and using this library. 

- Considering the size of our app, we constructed very thorough E2E testing using Cypress. 

- It was a challenge connecting all of the many components and deviating from the expected structure to accommodate the scope of the project
